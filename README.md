# Univariate_bivariate_analysis
## 1. Univariate Analysis:

Definition: Univariate analysis involves the examination of a single variable at a time.
The primary goal is to understand the distribution and characteristics of the variable.
Techniques: Common techniques include frequency distribution tables, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.
Examples:
Analyzing the distribution of customer ages in a dataset.
Examining the frequency of different product categories sold in a store.

## 2. Bivariate Analysis:

Definition: Bivariate analysis involves the simultaneous analysis of two variables to determine the empirical relationship between them.
The main goal is to understand the relationship, association, or correlation between the two variables.
Techniques: Common techniques include scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and cross-tabulation.

Examples:
Exploring the relationship between advertising spend and sales revenue.
Investigating the correlation between students' study hours and their exam scores.

## 3. Multivariate Analysis:

Definition: Multivariate analysis involves the examination of more than two variables simultaneously.
The primary goal is to understand the complex interactions and relationships between multiple variables.
Techniques: Common techniques include multiple regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis.

Examples:
Analyzing the factors that influence customer satisfaction, including service quality, product quality, and price.
Exploring the relationships between multiple demographic variables and purchasing behavior.
